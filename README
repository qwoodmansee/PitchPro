Pitch Pro is an iOS application which allows users to play any pitch or any interval in the standard western scale. It will also allow users to switch between different tuning systems in real time to hear how differently they sound.

Pitch Pro was developed as a part of a Senior Project for the Music Technology program at Capital University, and was developed by Quinton Woodmansee.
